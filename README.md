# IWSLT2024 - Low-resource Speech Translation Track: Quechua-Spanish Parallel Corpus

Repository for sharing the data in the Quechua language, one of the languages for the low-resource speech translation track at IWSLT 2024.

## Parallel data

This corpus is a small fraction of the Huqariq corpus [(Zevallos et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05498) translated into Spanish. It comprises 1 hour, 40 minutes of clean speech in Quechua, translated into Spanish (que_spa_clean). This version contains a validation and test data set.

The raw text transcriptions are located in `que_spa_clean/<split>/txt/<split>.<lang>`.

True-cased Spanish target translations are found in `que_spa_clean/<split>/txt/<split>.spa.tc`.

True-casing was done with a [sacremoses](https://github.com/alvations/sacremoses) Truecaser model trained on the Spanish side of WMT13 EN-ES.

## Additional Audio data

In addition to the 1 hour, 40 minutes of Quechua audio data aligned with Spanish translations, we also provided participants with a corpus of 60 hours of fully transcribed Quechua audio. All of this data comes from the Siminchik corpus.

Participants are not required to use any of this data.

Due to their size, this data is made available through this website.

## Additional Parallel Text data

As part of the constrained task, we allow parallel text from previous work.
Participants are also not required to use this data.

The data is found in this repository and called: "additional_mt_text".
They are extracted from the JW300 and Hinantin websites and used in the cited work below.
